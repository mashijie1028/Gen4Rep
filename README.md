## Introduction

Recent works demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing visual representations with generative models, where generative models take visual tokens as conditions and perform reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored.

We empirically reveal that perfect generation (reconstruction) does not always yield desirable visual representasions, as shown below:

In this work, we delve into three aspects to explore the critical factors: (1) conditioning mechanisms, (2) denoising configurations and (3) generation paradigms.

We propose a two-stage post-training method to enhance CLIP ViT's fine-grained visual representations, which is efficient (with only lightweight denoisers) and versatile (applicable to both continuous and discrete denoisers). The pipeline of our method is illustrated below:
